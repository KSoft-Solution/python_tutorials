We strongly suggest that you try them _after_ you've got a good initial model.\n","* __Use pre-trained embeddings__: you can use pre-trained weights from [there](http://ahogrammer.com/2017/01/20/the-list-of-pretrained-word-embeddings/) to kickstart your Embedding layer.\n","  * Use nn.Embedding.from_pretrained to init the embedding layer with a pretrained matrix.\n","  * When using pre-trained embeddings, pay attention to the fact that model's dictionary is different from your own.\n","  * You may want to freeze the parameters of embedding layer for several first epoches of fine-tuning or to not fine-tune them at all. In the first case you can choose zero learning rate for this parameter group, in the second case just use the freeze argument of nn.Embedding.from_pretrained.\n","* __More efficient batching__: right now it spends a lot of time iterating over \"0\"s\n","  * This happens because batch is always padded to the length of a longest sentence\n","  * You can speed things up by pre-generating batches of similar lengths and feeding it with randomly chosen pre-generated batch.\n","  * This technically breaks the i.i.d. assumption, but it works unless you come up with some insane rnn architectures.\n","* __Structured loss functions__: since we're tagging the whole sequence at once, we might as well train our network to do so.\n","  * There's more than one way to do so, but we'd recommend starting with [Conditional Random Fields](http://blog.echen.me/2012/01/03/introduction-to-conditional-random-fields/)\n","  * You can read an [official PyTorch tutorial on Bi-LSTM Conditional Random Field](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/advanced_tutorial.html#bi-lstm-conditional-random-field-discussion).\n"]}]}
